\section{Empirical Performance}

% Experimental results

% Things to be tested
We evaluated the options defined using our method on the Taxi domain
described in \secref{sec:approach}. We compared the performance of
MacroQ learning agents using the following option schemes,
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Small World} Options were generated randomly connecting two nodes of
       the domain using an inverse square law, as described in
       \secref{sec:approach}, with $r = 2$.
   \item \textbf{Betweenness} Options were generated to take any node to a local maxima
       of the betweenness function.
   \item \textbf{Random} Options were generated by randomly connecting two nodes in the
       domain.
   \item \textbf{None} No options were used.
\end{itemize}

\section{What are Useful Options?}
\label{sec:useful-options}

In this section, we will attempt to build a characterisation of what a
useful option is.

% Constructing Options 
We construct an option `short-circuiting' two states using a policy constructed
from the shortest path on this graph. For every state $x$, we select a state to
be short-circuited $y$ with using a multinomial distribution with weight
proportional to the distance between them in the state space, i.e. $w(x,y)
\propto d(x,y)^{-r}$. 

Another example of constructing an option on this graph would be to define a
policy that takes any state to a particular one along the shortest path. This is
the approach adopted by Simsek and Barto in \cite{Simsek}, where local maxima of
the betweenness scores are used to identify bottlenecks, and options defined to
reach these bottlenecks optimally from any state.

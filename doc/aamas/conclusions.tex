% Contributions
% - new scheme for generating options
We have devised a new scheme to generate options based on small world
network model. The options generated satisfy an intuitive criteria, that
the subtasks learnt should be easily composed to solve any other task.
The options also greatly improve the connectivity properties of the
domain.

% - absolutely model-free
Experiments run on standard domains show significantly faster learning
rates using small world options. At the same time, we have shown that
learning small world options can be significantly cheaper than learning
`bottleneck' options. Another advantage of the scheme is that is does
not ever require the model of the MDP. We find it remarkable that we can
learn near optimal behaviour just from the policies of on some tasks


% - theoretical interest
The scheme does not perform any global analysis, and does not require
the model. We have shown that sample-wise, it can be far cheaper than
other bottleneck based methods. Does not lead to state space blow up.
Also is interesting from a theoretical perspective, logarithmic number
of decisions.

% Further work
% - dynamically add/remove options
% - figuring out r
We have as yet not been able to characterise what the exponent $r$
should be in a general domain. Given the ease with which options can be
discovered, it would be interesting to create a dynamic scheme.
